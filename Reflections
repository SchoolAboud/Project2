Liam - My role in the project:
-Assisted in debugging:
    The work to transfer mutual methods went smooth, but as usual there were small errors and hiccups through our methods
which I looked over and worked to debug in both solo and group sessions.

-Reviewed code for mutual methods/fields:
    In addition I also continuously reviewed our code to see if there was anything we could put into the abstract class
or otherwise reuse to reduce duplicate code.

-Worked with team to optimize methods:
    I also assisted the team by meeting regularly to discuss improvements to the code, work through difficult logic, and
make general simplifications to the code if necessary.
